		% What is Tetris		
		Tetris is a popular video game created in 1984 by computer programmer Alexey Pajitnov  \cite{about-tetris}. It is a puzzle game that requires players to strategically place sequences of pieces known as "Tetriminos" into a rectangular Matrix (refer to Figure \ref{fig:tetrisgame}). In the classic game, players attempt to clear as many lines as possible by completely filling horizontal rows of blocks, but if the Tetriminos surpass the top of the Matrix, the game ends.

		% Tetris and computer science
		Since its release, mathematicians and computer scientists have been intrigued by the game of Tetris, leading to a diverse array of research endeavours exploring the various facets of the game, including its computational complexity \cite{tetris-is-hard-even-to-approx}, and its possibility of being won \cite{can-you-win-at-tetris} \cite{how-to-lose-at-tetris}.
		
		\section{Motivation}
		
			% In this section, you'll explain why your capstone project is important and relevant. What inspired you to pursue this topic? Is there a particular problem or challenge in the field that you're interested in addressing?
			% Consider discussing the broader significance of your research topic, such as its potential impact on society, industry, or academia. Why should readers care about your project?
			% You might also highlight any personal or professional experiences that motivated your interest in the topic.
	 		
	 		In their paper, \citeauthor{tetris-is-hard-even-to-approx} showed that it is NP-complete to optimise several natural objective functions of Tetris \cite{tetris-is-hard-even-to-approx}. NP-completeness poses a significant challenge in computational problem-solving, as it denotes the absence of polynomial-time algorithms for efficient solutions \cite{sipser-intro-to-computation}. Moreover, the discovery of a polynomial-time algorithm for any NP-complete problem implies that any problem in the set of NP, encompassing efficiently verifiable but potentially difficult problems, could be solved in polynomial time \cite{sipser-intro-to-computation}. NP-completeness extends beyond Tetris, with real-life instances of NP-complete arising in diverse fields such as route optimisation \cite{route-optimisation-np-complete}, job scheduling \cite{job-scheduling-np-complete}, and medicine \cite{medical-diagnosis-np-complete}.
	 		
	 		To address these challenges, researchers have explored alternative approaches to tackle NP-complete problems, including the use of nature-inspired algorithms \cite{job-shop-ga}. Although they might fail at finding optimal solutions, nature-inspired algorithms are able to return acceptable solutions in shorter running times \cite{review-nia-wael}. In the context of optimising Tetris gameplay, studies have shown the effectiveness of using nature-inspired algorithms in playing the classic single-player game \cite{tetris-ga-lewis} \cite{swarm-tetris}. However, there remains limited research on the effectiveness of nature-inspired optimisation algorithms in the multiplayer versus variant of the game.
			
		\section{Problem Statement}
			
			% Here, you'll clearly define the problem or issue that your capstone project aims to address. What specific challenge or question are you seeking to answer?
			% Describe the current state of the problem and any existing solutions or approaches. What limitations or shortcomings do these solutions have?
			% Be concise and specific in articulating the problem statement, making it clear to readers what your project seeks to contribute to the field.
			
			% Despite the extensive research on classic Tetris, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding its multiplayer versus variant (refer to Figure \ref{tetrio}). This gap presents an intriguing problem within the field of computational gaming, as understanding the optimal strategies, challenges, and computational complexities unique to multiplayer versus Tetris remains largely uncharted territory.
			
			\textit{Versus Tetris} (refer to Figure \ref{fig:versus-example}) presents a unique challenge in computational gaming due to its complex dynamics and real-time competitive nature. While previous research regarding the use of nature-inspired algorithms for Tetris optimisation have focused on single-player scenarios, the effectiveness of these algorithms in the multiplayer context remains largely unexplored. Despite the demonstrated success of these algorithms in improving single-player Tetris gameplay, their application to the multiplayer variant poses distinct challenges due to a different rule set and differing objectives that require further investigation.

		\section{The Difficulty of Tetris} \label{sec:diff-of-tetris}
		
			In their article, \citeauthor{tetris-is-hard-even-to-approx} \cite{tetris-is-hard-even-to-approx} proved that optimising several natural objectives of Tetris is NP-complete, even with a deterministic finite piece sequence. A deterministic finite piece sequence refers to a game at which the player knows every single piece in the sequence, and where there are finite pieces in the sequence, i.e. the game can end without the player losing. The authors defined the natural objectives of the game as follows \cite{tetris-is-hard-even-to-approx}:
			
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item maximising the number of rows cleared;
				\item maximising the number of piece placed;
				\item maximising the number of Tetrises - clearing four lines on the same move;
				\item minimising the height of the highest filled grid square.
			\end{enumerate}
			
			In \citeyear{tetris-o1-np-hard}, \citeauthor{tetris-o1-np-hard} \cite{tetris-o1-np-hard} demonstrated that playing any game of Tetris with a matrix of eight or more columns, or four or more rows, is NP-complete, further showcasing the difficulty of the game . Both of these papers aim to highlight the difficulty of the game, but what does difficulty actually entail?
			
			This section aims to elucidate some of the key concepts of computational complexity, which involves the study of intrinsic difficulties of computational problems \cite{cc:conceptual-perspective}, and attempt to justify the use of non-traditional algorithmic approaches to play the game.
			
			\subsection{Complexity Classes}\label{subsec:compclass}
				
				The study of computational complexity asks questions about the intrinsic difficulty of computational problems \cite{cc:conceptual-perspective}. Complexity classes are usually defined by referring to computation models and by putting suitable restrictions on them \cite{uniform-cc}. 
				
				The class \textit{P} encompasses all decision problems that are polynomial time solvable using a deterministic model of computation \cite{cc:modern}. In this model, for any given input, the machine's computation follows a single predetermined path \cite{sipser-intro-to-computation}. 
				
				The complexity class \textit{NP}, on the other hand is the class of all decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic algorithm \cite{computers-and-intractability}. The nondeterministic model of computation allows for guessing correct solutions out of polynomially many options in constant time \cite{npcompleteness}, and solutions can be verified in deterministic polynomial time \cite{sipser-intro-to-computation}.
				
				If all problems in \textit{NP} can be reduced to some problem $X$, $X$ is said to be \textit{NP-hard} \cite{sipser-intro-to-computation}. Reductions are useful in showing the relationship between computable problems, as a reduction from problem $A$ to problem $B$ tells us that problem $B$ is at least as hard as problem $A$ \cite{npcompleteness}.
				
				For a problem to be considered \textit{NP-complete}, it must be a member of both the \textit{NP} and \textit{NP-hard} classes (refer to Figure \ref{fig:p,np,npcomplete}) \cite{npcompleteness}. Therefore, \textit{NP-complete} problems are some of the hardest problems in \textit{NP} \cite{cc:modern}.

						\end{tikzpicture}
					\end{adjustbox}
					\caption{\centering Visualisation of the sets P, NP, NP-hard and NP-complete.}
					\label{fig:p,np,npcomplete}
				\end{figure}
				
				Since all problems in \textit{NP} can be reduced to any \textit{NP-complete} problem, if a deterministic polynomial time algorithm can be found for an \textit{NP-complete} problem, it would also mean that the set \textit{NP} is polynomial-time solvable, proving \textit{NP} and \textit{P} are equal sets. The question of whether \textit{P} $=$ \textit{NP} has famously been immortalised as one of the millennium prize problems from the Clay Institute of Mathematics \cite{claymathMillenniumPrize}. Most researchers believe that \textit{P} $\ne$ \textit{NP} since years of effort have failed to yield efficient algorithms for \textit{NP-complete} problems \cite{cc:modern}.
			
			\subsection{Justifying Non-traditional Algorithmic Approaches}
			
%			Since even in with less randomised rules, Tetris is NP-complete, we should turn our attention to non-traditional algorithmic approaches, but first, we should show why we shouldn't be looking into traditional approaches in the first place.
%			We should mention in this section that Versus Tetris has different rules compared to the ones studied by Demaine et al. Demain et al: The difficulty of the offline version should imply the difficulty of the online version. Despite this difference, the game 
				
				It is important to note that even though \citeauthor{tetris-is-hard-even-to-approx}'s \cite{tetris-is-hard-even-to-approx} proof is based on a variant of Tetris that is quite different from Versus Tetris, the difficulty of Versus Tetris can be implied from the proof. Versus Tetris introduces additional gameplay factors, such as the competitive aspect where players can send ``garbage'' lines to their opponents, adding layers of complexity. As such, Versus Tetris is arguably more difficult than its classic variant, or  \citeauthor{tetris-is-hard-even-to-approx}'s variant \cite{tetris-is-hard-even-to-approx}.
				
				Given the NP-completeness of Tetris \cite{tetris-is-hard-even-to-approx} \cite{tetris-o1-np-hard}, it is evident that traditional deterministic algorithmic approaches would face significant challenges in efficiently solving the game \cite{cc:conceptual-perspective}. The NP-completeness of the game implies that obtaining exact solutions are computationally intractable within a reasonable time frame.
				
				To address this, we may relax the requirements for a solution. This can be done by either broadening the set of acceptable solutions or focusing on average-case scenarios instead of worst-case scenarios \cite{cc:conceptual-perspective}. This shift in focus allows the use of more practical, non-traditional algorithms that provide acceptable solutions within a reasonable time, even if they are not optimal. 
							
		\section{Some Approaches Taken to Solve Tetris}
		
			% Explain the approaches taken to tackle the Tetris problem
			% Should define each approach, and probably mention why the the algorithms were chosen.
			
			Now that the difficulty of Tetris has been established, we turn our attention to potential strategies that can be used to handle the game's complexity. In this section, we explore some of the innovative approaches that have been utilised to tackle the game of Tetris.
			
			\subsection{Learning by Imitation}
			
				In \citeyear{tetris-learning-by-imitation}, \citeauthor{tetris-learning-by-imitation} \cite{tetris-learning-by-imitation} employed a learning by imitation approach to the game of Tetris. Imitation learning aims to mimic human behaviour in some given task by learning a mapping between observations of demonstrations \cite{imitation-learning}.
				
				In their approach, played Tetris games were fed into a machine learning model as inputs, where the model would receive positive feedback when a decision matched that of the imitated system, and negative feedback otherwise \cite{tetris-learning-by-imitation}. The learning is deemed successful if the trained model maintains similarity even when faced with data outside of the training set.
				
				The learning system consists of several components, including filters, pattern calculators, and support vector machines (SVMs) (refer to Figure \ref{fig:syscomponents-learning-by-imitation}) \cite{tetris-learning-by-imitation}. Because of the time consuming nature of training SVMs, each Tetrimino had its own dedicated filters, pattern calculators and SVMs, i.e. seven SVMs \footnote{Seven SVMs for the seven Tetriminos.} are working together in the artificial player. The output of any particular SVM describes how similar a candidate move is to the choice of the imitated player.

					\tikzstyle{block} = [rectangle, draw, 
					text width=6em, text centered, rounded corners, minimum height=4em]

						\draw [arrow] (svm) -- (output);
					\end{tikzpicture}
					\caption{Abstraction of \citeauthor{tetris-learning-by-imitation}'s System Components}
					\label{fig:syscomponents-learning-by-imitation}
				\end{figure}
				
				Filters are made up of a multitude of patterns, which can be thought of as specific configurations in the playing field that the model uses to recognise and evaluate different game states \cite{tetris-learning-by-imitation}. Patterns do not take into account the whole matrix, but only a small area in the playing field. Thus, the authors included a list of 19 hand-coded features that takes a more global look at the game, some notable features include the number of holes that will be created after the current placement, and the number of removed lines after the current placement. Both the activated patterns and the features are passed into the support vector machine, and the move that is calculated to be the most similar is played.
				
				To evaluate their approach, \citeauthor{tetris-learning-by-imitation} used a human player as well as Fahey's artificial player \cite{fahey-ai} as systems for their model to imitate \cite{tetris-learning-by-imitation}. The outcome shows that their model can learn different styles of gameplay based on the imitated player, which is to be expected. When pitting the two learned models against each other in their variant of two-player Tetris \footnote{In \citeauthor{tetris-learning-by-imitation}'s variant of two-player Tetris, clearing $n$ lines sends $n-1$ attack rows to the opponent, with each attack row containing $n-1$ empty cells \cite{tetris-learning-by-imitation}.}, they found that the human imitated machine performed better than the one imitated from Fahey's AI. However, The system imitated from Fahey's AI outperformed that of the human imitated system in single player games.
