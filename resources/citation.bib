There is also a section on the creator of Tetris. As this is the 'About Us' page of the official Tetris website, this is treated as a credible source. This source will be used to introduce the Tetris game. It gives readers a good amount of information without being too overwhelming."

	abstract="In the popular computer game of Tetris, the player is given a sequence of tetromino pieces and must pack them into a rectangular gameboard initially occupied by a given configuration of filled squares; any completely filled row of the gameboard is cleared and all pieces above it drop by one row. We prove that in the offline version of Tetris, it is NP-complete to maximize the number of cleared rows, maximize the number of tetrises (quadruples of rows simultaneously filled and cleared), minimize the maximum height of an occupied square, or maximize the number of pieces placed before the game ends. We furthermore show the extreme inapproximability of the first and last of these objectives to within a factor of p1−ɛ, when given a sequence of p pieces, and the inapproximability of the third objective to within a factor of 2−$\epsilon$, for any $\epsilon$ > 0. Our results hold under several variations on the rules of Tetris, including different models of rotation, limitations on player agility, and restricted piecesets.",

	annotation="In their paper, Demaine et al. mathematically proves that the natural objectives of Tetris - minimising the height of an occupied square, maximising the number of pieces placed, maximising the number of cleared rows and maximising the number of Tetrises (clearing four lines in a row) are NP-complete. This paper is credible because rigorous mathematical proof is used to come to its conclusions. This source will be used to introduce the NP-completeness of Tetris, a central motivation behind the project."

	annotation="In this paper, Lewis explores the application of genetic algorithms to optimise Tetris gameplay. It delves into representing Tetris states using features such as game score and board configuration, with moves selected based on weighted feature sums. Through a genetic algorithm framework involving population-based selection, mutation, and crossover, the paper demonstrates the evolution of Tetris-playing strategies over 30 generations. Results indicate significant improvements in gameplay efficiency, with optimised players achieving an average game length of 179,531 moves and an average score efficiency of 2.5. This paper will be used as an example of using nature-inspired algorithms in tackling Tetris."

	abstract = {This book is rooted in the thesis that complexity theory is extremely rich in conceptual content, and that this contents should be explicitly communicated in expositions and courses on the subject. The desire to provide a corresponding textbook is indeed the motivation for writing the current book and its main governing principle.The book offers a conceptual perspective on complexity theory, and the presentation is designed to highlight this perspective. It is intended mainly for students that wish to learn complexity theory and for educators that intend to teach a course on complexity theory. The book is also intended to promote interest in complexity theory and make it acccessible to general readers with adequate background (which is mainly being comfortable with abstract discussions, definitions and proofs). We expect most readers to have a basic knowledge of algorithms, or at least be fairly comfortable with the notion of an algorithm.The book focuses on several sub-areas of complexity theory (including, e.g., pseudorandomness and probabilistic proof systems). In each case, the exposition starts from the intuitive questions addresses by the sub-area, as embodied in the concepts that it studies. The exposition discusses the fundamental importance of these questions, the choices made in the actual formulation of these questions and notions, the approaches that underly the answers, and the ideas that are embedded in these answers. Our view is that these (non-technical") aspects are the core of the field, and the presentation attempts to re ect this view.},

	abstract = {Complexity classes are usually defined by referring to computation models and by putting suitable restrictions on them. Following this approach, many proofs of results are tightly bound to the characteristics of the computation model and of its restrictions and, therefore, they sometimes hide the essential properties which insure the obtained results. In order to obtain more general results, a uniform family of computation models which encompasses most of the complexity classes of interest is introduced. As a first initial set of results derivable from the proposed approach, we will give a sufficient and necessary condition for proving separations of relativized complexity classes, a characterization of complexity classes with complete languages and a sufficient condition for proving strong separations of relativized complexity classes. Examples of applications of these results to some specific complexity classes are then given. Additional results related to separations by sparse oracles can be found in Bovet (1991).}
